# VHDL
 8-bit RISC microcontroller design in VHDL
The purpose of this project is to design, simulate, and synthesize a behavioral embedded microcontroller. We will design a microcontroller that is compact, capable, and cost-effective fully embedded 8-bit RISC microcontroller core optimized for the many FPGA families. In this design, the focus is to bring the most significant advantages that a processor can offer to a design environment at minimum cost. For this reason, these small processors have been considered to be "Programmable State Machines" and are referred to as "PSM". A PSM, like any other processor, will execute a program. A program is formed by a set of instructions that are defined by the user and held in a memory. Each instruction is encoded into a machine code.
